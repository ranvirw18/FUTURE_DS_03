Student Feedback Analysis Report - Power BI
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student perception data to evaluate teaching effectiveness across various departments. The primary objective is to monitor faculty performance against an institutional benchmark of 8.0/10.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of teaching scores, student participation, and specific category ratings, allowing educational administrators to identify strengths and areas requiring strategic intervention.

📊 Key Features & KPIs
Overall Teaching Score: A high-level KPI showing the average rating across all faculty and courses (Current: 5.96).

Performance Gauge: A visual representation of the current score compared to the target benchmark of 8.0.

Participation Tracking: Total count of Student IDs (1,001) to ensure data significance.

Categorical Breakdown: A horizontal bar chart comparing metrics such as:

Course Recommendations

Degree of Difficulty

Explanation of Concepts

Subject Knowledge

Doubt Resolution

Quality Assurance Insights: A dedicated section for automated/manual key observations and recommendations.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
Power BI Desktop: For data visualization and dashboard design.

Power Query: For data cleaning, handling null values in feedback, and ensuring data integrity across 1,000+ entries.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): * Created Measures for Overall Teaching Score.

Calculated participation counts and percentage distributions.

Data Modeling: Established relationships between student demographics and course evaluation metrics.

📈 Key Insights from the Analysis
Benchmark Gap: The institution is currently performing at 5.96, which is significantly below the 8.0 target, suggesting a need for faculty training programs.

Mastery vs. Communication: Faculty show high scores in Subject Knowledge, but significantly lower scores in the Explanation of Concepts, indicating a gap in pedagogical delivery rather than technical expertise.

Practical Application: Metrics related to the practical application of theory consistently underperform, representing a critical area for curriculum improvement.
